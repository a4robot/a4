# A4 ROBOTICS

Welcome to the official GitHub organization page for A4 ROBOTICS!

## About Us

A4 ROBOTICS specializes in providing the "power of knowing WHAT and WHERE things are" through visual perception and positioning. We help improve:

*   **Data Reliability and Consistency** by knowing what is in a location and where an item is.
*   **Safety** by knowing what is and is not in a location, and where it belongs.
*   **Productivity** by identifying items of interest and where action can be taken.

We achieve this by focusing on:
*   **DETECT**
*   **ESTIMATE**
*   **LOCALIZE**

## What We Offer

*   **DEV KIT**: For developers to kickstart AI/Robot projects, supporting up to 8 cameras, NVIDIA Jetson (Nano, Orin Nano, Orin NX), and 4G & 5G.
*   **CUSTOMIZATION**: For users needing tools to track and trace objects of interest, including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR) that work in GNSS-denied environments.
*   **INTEGRATION**: For product/service providers to enhance existing offerings with new autonomous capabilities, such as adding autonomous controllers to existing vehicles.

## Examples of Our Work
